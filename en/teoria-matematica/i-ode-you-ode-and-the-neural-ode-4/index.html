<p>Yes, I know, post-holiday slumps hit everyone hard. But hey, someone has to do the dirty work, right? So let's pick up, 
after a few weeks' break, our delightful little chat about <strong>Neural ODEs</strong>, or <strong>NODEs</strong>. If you missed the earlier parts, 
don't worry, they're linked at the end of the article. To recap quickly, we’ve already talked 
about <a href="/en/teoria-matematica/i-ode-you-ode-and-the-neural-ode-1/" target="_blank">differential and integral calculus</a>, 
and <a href="/en/teoria-matematica/i-ode-you-ode-and-the-neural-ode-2/" target="_blank">analytical</a> and 
<a href="/en/teoria-matematica/i-ode-you-ode-and-the-neural-ode-3/" target="_blank">numerical</a> methods for 
solving differential equations. Now, finally, it’s time to put it all together and 
see how we arrive at the formulation of these blessed NODEs. So let’s begin...</p>
<h3 id="from-discrete-to-continuous">From Discrete to Continuous<a class="headerlink" href="#from-discrete-to-continuous" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>There are many neural network architectures. Too many, in fact. Among them, there's one in particular known as
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385" target="_blank"><strong>ResNet</strong></a>, or <strong>Residual Network</strong>. ResNets were a major 
breakthrough in the world of Deep Learning because they helped overcome certain training issues. What 
kind of issues, you might ask? Well, here's the idea: to improve performance, a neural network typically 
needs to be deeper. But the deeper it gets, the worse the performance becomes due to 
<strong>Gradient Vanishing/Explosion</strong> nasty problems we won’t delve into here, but trust me, they’re trouble.
What makes ResNets special is the use of <strong>residual blocks</strong>. To put it simply, a 
ResNet is a series of these blocks, each structured like this:</p>
<p class="image-caption"><img alt="ResBlock" class="image" src="https://www.lucadivita.it/en/images/teoria_matematica/neural_ode_4/res_block.svg"/>
Figure 1. Residual Block</p>
<p>Now it should be clear why it’s called <strong>residual</strong>. The output is:</p>
<div class="math">$$
y = F(x) + x
$$</div>
<p>which can be rearranged as:</p>
<div class="math">$$
F(x) = y - x
$$</div>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(x\)</span> is the input</li>
<li><span class="math">\(y\)</span> is the output</li>
<li><span class="math">\(F(x)\)</span> is the <strong>transformation</strong> performed by the layers (i.e., the residual)</li>
</ul>
<p>So what the individual layers learn is not a full mapping to <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, but rather the <strong>residuals</strong>.</p>
<p>But what does this have to do with NODEs? Hold your horses, we’re getting there. 
Let's start by imagining a ResNet with <strong>one layer</strong>:</p>
<p class="image-caption"><img alt="ResNet1" class="image" src="https://www.lucadivita.it/en/images/teoria_matematica/neural_ode_4/resnet_1.svg"/>
Figure 2. One-Layer ResNet</p>
<p>The output is given by:</p>
<div class="math">$$
x_1 = f_1(x_0, \theta_1) + x_0
$$</div>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> is the input to the ResNet</li>
<li><span class="math">\(f_1\)</span> is the transformation layer</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\theta_1\)</span> are the weights of that layer</li>
<li><span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> is the output</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let's take a <strong>two-layer</strong> ResNet:</p>
<p class="image-caption"><img alt="ResNet2" class="image" src="https://www.lucadivita.it/en/images/teoria_matematica/neural_ode_4/resnet_2.svg"/>
Figure 3. Two-Layer ResNet</p>
<p>Now the output is:</p>
<div class="math">$$
x_2 = f_2(x_1, \theta_2) + x_1
$$</div>
<p>One more. Let's look at a <strong>three-layer</strong> ResNet:</p>
<p class="image-caption"><img alt="ResNet3" class="image" src="https://www.lucadivita.it/en/images/teoria_matematica/neural_ode_4/resnet_3.svg"/>
Figure 4. Three-Layer ResNet</p>
<p>The output is:</p>
<div class="math">$$
x_3 = f_3(x_2, \theta_3) + x_2
$$</div>
<p>Did you get the hint...? So why not think of the depth of the network as a <strong>temporal sequence</strong>, where each layer <span class="math">\(f_i\)</span> represents a <strong>discrete time step</strong>?
And why not suppose we have <strong>infinite layers</strong>, and thus infinite <span class="math">\(f_i\)</span>, one for each time step...? Sure, let’s do it! And let’s <strong>generalize</strong>:</p>
<div class="math">$$
x_{t} = f_{t}(x_{t-1}, \theta_t) + x_{t-1}
$$</div>
<p>But at this point, why not imagine having <strong>a single function</strong> <span class="math">\(f\)</span> that varies <strong>with time</strong>, instead of infinite <span class="math">\(f_i\)</span>?
So let's write it like this:</p>
<div class="math">$$
x_{t} = f(x_{t-1}, t, \theta_{t}) + x_{t-1}
$$</div>
<p>Does this formulation ring a bell? No!? Maybe it will if I add a multiplicative factor <span class="math">\(h=1\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">$$
x_{t} = x_{t-1} + h \cdot f(x_{t-1}, t, \theta_{t})
$$</div>
<p>Hopefully that’s clearer now. By now you should be familiar with the <strong>Euler formula</strong>. 
If not, catch up <a href="/en/teoria-matematica/i-ode-you-ode-and-the-neural-ode-3/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>From this formulation, we can write:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{x_{t} - x_{t-1} }{h} = f(x_{t-1}, t, \theta_{t})
$$</div>
<p>This should also look familiar, it's the <a href="/en/teoria-matematica/i-ode-you-ode-and-the-neural-ode-1/#in-the-beginning-was-the-derivative" target="_blank">finite difference quotient</a>.
So, assuming we can control the value of <span class="math">\(h\)</span>, we can easily write:</p>
<p><a id="nn-differenziale"></a>
</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x(t), t, \theta)
$$</div>
<p class="formula-caption">
Formula 1. Differential Formulation of the Neural ODE</p>
<p>So, if we could find a way to consider small variations of our <span class="math">\(f\)</span> by introducing an arbitrarily <strong>small <span class="math">\(h\)</span></strong>, our problem would shift from being a <strong>sequence of large steps</strong> (i.e., discrete layers with <span class="math">\(h = 1\)</span>) to <strong>infinitely small steps</strong>.</p>
<p>And so, at least conceptually, we've transitioned from a <strong>discrete problem</strong> with many functions <span class="math">\(f_t(x, \theta_t)\)</span> to a <strong>continuous one</strong> that <em>evolves smoothly over time</em>, guided by a single <span class="math">\(f(x(t), t, \theta)\)</span>. Visually, this looks like:</p>
<p class="image-caption"><img alt="RawNode" class="image" src="https://www.lucadivita.it/en/images/teoria_matematica/neural_ode_4/raw_node.svg"/>
Figure 5. From Discrete to Continuous</p>
<p>At this point, the next step comes naturally. If we have a derivative that tells us how our state changes, we can ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how much does it change over time?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer, as always: <strong>we integrate</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="integrate-it-away">Integrate It Away<a class="headerlink" href="#integrate-it-away" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>We've just obtained a neat <a href="#nn-differenziale" target="_blank">differential equation</a> that tells us <strong>how the state changes over time</strong>.
Great, but what we really want to know is <strong>how much it changes</strong>, that is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I start from <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> at time <span class="math">\(t_0\)</span>, where will I be at time <span class="math">\(t_N\)</span>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer, if you've read even a single line of the previous articles, you already know: <strong>we integrate</strong>.</p>
<p><a id="formulazione-integrale-node"></a>
</p>
<div class="math">$$
x(t_N) = x(t_0) + \int_{t_0}^{t_N} f(x(t), t, \theta) \, dt
$$</div>
<p class="formula-caption">
Formula 2. Integral Formulation of the Neural ODE</p>
<p>This, ladies and gentlemen, is the <strong>heart</strong> of a NODE. 
No more list of layers, but a <em>continuous dynamic evolving over time</em>, driven by a function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> that learns <strong>how the state should change</strong>. 
And this <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, surprise surprise, is nothing but a neural network.</p>
<p>The fun part begins. How do you <strong>analytically integrate</strong> a function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> that, let’s not forget, is a neural network packed with ReLUs, nonlinear layers, and scattered weights?</p>
<p>Quick answer? <strong>You can’t</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s why I wrote an entire article on <a href="/en/teoria-matematica/i-ode-you-ode-and-the-neural-ode-3/" target="_blank"><strong>numerical methods</strong></a>. I’m no amateur.
And remember in those solvers, what was the parameter that controlled the <strong>integration step</strong>? Exactly... it was <span class="math">\(h\)</span>.
So that idea we introduced in the previous paragraph, introducing an <span class="math">\(h\)</span> <strong>as small as we like</strong>, not only makes sense, it’s exactly what we do.</p>
<h3 id="houston-we-have-a-problem-with-training">Houston, We Have a Problem... With Training<a class="headerlink" href="#houston-we-have-a-problem-with-training" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>We know we can’t solve our integral analytically, but numerically? Who’s stopping us? So, for now, let’s just write this:</p>
<p><a id="formulazione-numerica-node"></a>
</p>
<div class="math">$$
x(t_N) = ODESolve(f(x(t), t, \theta), x_0, t_0, t_N)
$$</div>
<p class="formula-caption">
Formula 3. Numerical Formulation of the Neural ODE</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(f\)</span> <em>is not your typical problem</em>. It’s not Lotka Volterra or anything like that, it’s a neural network with its layers, nonlinearities, and activations.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> are the weights of the neural network, i.e., the <strong>parameters to optimize</strong>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> is the <strong>initial state</strong> (the input to the neural network), and it’s known.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(t_0\)</span> is the <strong>starting time</strong>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(t_N\)</span> is the <strong>ending time</strong>, the moment we observe the <strong>output</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve read the articles on neurons, you know that training a neural network means <strong>optimizing</strong> the weights.
This is done by computing the <strong>Loss</strong>, which is the error between the predicted output and the desired one, and propagating it backward through backpropagation,
modifying the <strong>weights</strong> based on how much they contributed to the error. Easy enough in the discrete world, right? Layer by layer, weight by weight. And now?
Now, every <strong>instant in the integration time</strong> contributes, bit by bit, to the final loss.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do we compute the error of something that evolves continuously over time?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The network is no longer made up of distinct layers. It’s now <strong>hidden</strong> inside an <strong>integrator</strong>.
There’s no longer a well-defined sequence of layers, like this:</p>
<div class="math">$$
Input \, x_0 \longmapsto Layer\, 1 \longmapsto Layer\, 2 \longmapsto \cdots \longmapsto Output
$$</div>
<p>where to reach the output <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, <em>a single</em> <strong>forward</strong> pass through the network is enough, whereas with NODEs we have:</p>
<div class="math">$$
Input \, x_0 \longmapsto ODESolve(f(x(t), t, \theta), t_0, t_N) \longmapsto Output

<p>We can no longer <strong>see</strong> or <strong>control</strong> the direct effect of each weight on the error, because the output is not directly produced by a neural network, but by an ODESolver that <em>integrates the dynamic system defined by the network itself</em>.
As we've seen, a solver <strong>repeatedly</strong> calls the dynamic function <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, depending on the value of <span class="math">\(h\)</span>. So now, each call to <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is a <strong>forward</strong> pass of the network. The result is used to <em>compute the next step's value</em>, until we reach the output <span class="math">\(y\)</span> at time <span class="math">\(t_N\)</span>, i.e., after <span class="math">\(n\)</span> forwards.</p>
<p>The differences between a NODE forward pass and that of a standard neural network are shown in the following diagrams:</p>

Figure 6. Neural ODE Forward Pass</p>
<p>The Loss, then, is no longer a <strong>simple error</strong> computed as a function of <em>true output</em> and <em>predicted output</em>, but something much more complex, it depends on all time steps, as shown in the image below.</p>
<p class="image-caption"><img alt="LossNode" class="image" src="https://www.lucadivita.it/en/images/teoria_matematica/neural_ode_4/loss_node.svg"/>
Figure 7. Loss in a Neural ODE</p>
<p>You can see each black dot as a <em>forward pass that generates the next step's output</em>, <strong>contributing</strong> to the Loss, 
starting from the initial instant <span class="math">\(t_0\)</span> and ending at <span class="math">\(t_N\)</span>, which produces the prediction <span class="math">\(y = x(t_N)\)</span>.</p>
<p>To recap, the initial inputs are given by <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span>, and the goal is to minimize the value of</p>
<div class="math">$$
L(x(t_N), y)
$$</div>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(L\)</span> is the Loss function</li>
<li><span class="math">\(y\)</span> is the true output</li>
<li><span class="math">\(x(t_N)\)</span> is the <strong>output from the ODESolver</strong>, obtained after <em>dozens or hundreds</em> of forward passes of the same neural network <span class="math">\(f\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, though, the question remains: How do we train the network to <strong>optimize</strong> <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>? In other words,
how do we perform <strong>backpropagation</strong> of the error knowing that the calculated Loss is <em>not the result of a single 
forward pass of the neural network</em>, but the result of an ODESolver, i.e., <span class="math">\(n\)</span> forward passes of the neural network?</p>
<h3 id="adjoint-at-the-table">Adjoint at the Table<a class="headerlink" href="#adjoint-at-the-table" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>If you’ve made it this far and actually understand what’s going on, great! You can explain it to me too!
But jokes aside, let’s continue. From the neuron series, we learned that minimizing the Loss means 
<strong>taking the derivative of the error with respect to the weights</strong>, that is:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{dL}{d \theta}
$$</div>
<p>In the previous section, however, we saw that in a NODE, the error results from <strong>many infinitesimal contributions</strong> 
generated by the states <span class="math">\(x(t_i)\)</span>, each of which uses the exact same set of weights <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>. So, by the chain rule, we can write:</p>
<p><a id="loss"></a>
</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{dL}{d \theta} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial x(t_i)} \cdot \frac{\partial x(t_i)}{\partial \theta}
$$</div>
<p class="formula-caption">
Formula 4. Gradient of the Loss</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\frac{\partial L}{\partial x(t_i)}\)</span> is the error contribution of the <strong><span class="math">\(i\)</span>-th state</strong></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\frac{dx}{d\theta}\)</span> is the contribution of the <strong>weights</strong> to the state <span class="math">\(x(t_i)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s focus on the quantity:</p>
<p><a id="sensibilita"></a>
</p>
<div class="math">$$
a(t) = \frac{dL}{dx(t_i)}
$$</div>
<p class="formula-caption">
Formula 5. Sensitivity</p>
<p>This value is also called the <strong>sensitivity</strong> of the Loss with respect to the state at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, and it represents the <em>instantaneous gradient</em>
that <strong>evolves</strong> over time, that is, how each state impacts the error. It answers the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I changed the state value, how much would the Loss value change?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And how do we quantify how much one quantity instantaneously affects another? Exactly, through the <strong>derivative</strong>.
So we can write:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{da(t)}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{dL}{dx(t_i)} \right)
$$</div>
<p>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_of_second_derivatives" target="_blank">Schwarz’s theorem</a>, we can rewrite it as:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{da(t)}{dt} = \frac{d}{dx(t_i)} \left( \frac{dL}{dt} \right)
$$</div>
<p>Now we’ve got the Loss as a function of time, but as we know, the <em>Loss is a function of the states</em>, and the <em>states are a function of time</em>,
so we can apply the <a href="/en/machine-learning/neurons-for-dummies-3/#the-chain-rule" target="_blank">chain rule</a> and write:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{dL}{dt} = \frac{dL}{dx(t_i)}\frac{dx(t_i)}{dt}
$$</div>
<p>Substituting into our previous expression gives:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{da(t)}{dt} = \frac{d}{dx(t_i)} \left( \frac{dL}{dx(t_i)}\frac{dx(t_i)}{dt} \right)
$$</div>
<p>Amid this jungle of derivatives, you probably didn’t notice that part of this formula was already defined 
<a href="#nn-differenziale" target="_blank">here</a>. So, replacing the notation for the <span class="math">\(i\)</span>-th state with a more general one, we can write:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{da(t)}{dt} = \frac{dL}{dx(t)} \frac{f(x(t), t, \theta)}{dx}
$$</div>
<p>And if you recall, we also wrote:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{dL}{dx(t)} = a(t)
$$</div>
<p>So let’s make one more substitution and write:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{da(t)}{dt} = a(t) \cdot \frac{f(x(t), t, \theta)}{dx}
$$</div>
<p>Now we’re just one step away. We’ve seen that to reach the final state, we used an ODESolver that evolves <strong>forward in time</strong>:
we start from the initial state <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> (the input) and reach the final state <span class="math">\(x_{t_N}\)</span> (the output). It’s at the final state that we can <strong>compute</strong> the Loss, but remember,
we have no information about the <strong>intermediate states</strong>, so backpropagation is off the table. To understand how each individual state contributed to the error, we must go
<strong>back in time</strong> starting from the state <span class="math">\(x(t_N)\)</span> and reaching the state <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span>. But this has some <strong>implications</strong>. Let me explain with an example: 
suppose you’re walking uphill and take a <em>step forward</em>. You’ve moved half a meter forward and find yourself <strong>higher up</strong>, say by <span class="math">\(5\%\)</span>. Now take that same exact step,
but <em>backward</em>. You still move half a meter, still on a <span class="math">\(5\%\)</span> slope, but this time you’re going <strong>downhill</strong>, you’ve descended by <span class="math">\(5\%\)</span>, which means you’re at <span class="math">\(-5\%\)</span>
relative to where you started. Mathematically, what we’re doing is ensuring that the derivative (i.e., the slope) remains <strong>consistent</strong>, it should correctly indicate not only
how steep the change is, but also whether we’re going up or down. In short, the error at time <span class="math">\(t_0\)</span> is <strong>zero</strong>, and as the dynamics evolve, it <strong>accumulates</strong> gradually 
until reaching the final error at time <span class="math">\(t_N\)</span>. Starting from the final error and retracing our steps backward, we must <strong>subtract</strong> the individual <strong>components</strong> until we reach time <span class="math">\(t_0\)</span>, where it becomes zero again.
So, to go back in time from the final state while keeping the gradient coherent, we need a nice big <strong>minus sign</strong>.
Let’s add it:</p>
<p><a id="adjoint-differenziale"></a>
</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{da(t)}{dt} = - a(t) \cdot \frac{f(x(t), t, \theta)}{dx}
$$</div>
<p class="formula-caption">
Formula 6. Differential Formulation of the Sensitivity</p>
<p>Yes, I know, I made it sound like this just <em>happens</em>, maybe even a bit <strong>forced</strong>, but really, you should be thanking me for sparing you the hassle of more formulas.
Still curious? You can find the proof for why we need the minus sign <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15141" target="_blank">here</a>. But back to us.

Formula 7. Integral Formulation of Sensitivity</p>
<p>What we just introduced is called the <strong>Adjoint Method</strong>, and why it’s not only useful but <strong>indispensable</strong>, we’ll see very soon.
Visually, what the adjoint method does is shown in the figure below:</p>

<p>We start from the final time step, for which we have all the necessary information since it’s the output, and we move backward in time,
calculating at each time step the <em>error sensitivity with respect to the current state</em>.
If there's one thing we've learned, it's that we hate analytical integrals. So how do we solve our
<strong>sensitivity equation</strong>...? And why, of course, with an ODESolver?</p>

<p>If you've made it this far, congratulations, but I imagine you're more confused than before. Because, in fact, the adjoint method as it stands 
seems quite useless. So, to avoid <strong>lynching</strong>, let’s give all this some meaning. Let's start again from the <a href="#loss" target="_blank">formulation of the loss</a>. 
The basics of mathematics tell us that whatever we do on the right, we must also do on the left, and everything will continue to hold. 
So, we differentiate both sides with respect to time:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{dL}{d \theta} \right) = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial x(t)} \cdot \frac{\partial x(t)}{\partial \theta} \right)
$$</div>
<p>By Schwarz’s theorem we can write:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{dL}{d \theta} \right) = \frac{d}{d\theta} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial x(t)} \cdot \frac{\partial x(t)}{\partial t} \right)
$$</div>
<p>From which, recalling <a href="#nn-differenziale" target="_blank">this equality</a> and <a href="#sensibilita" target="_blank">this other one</a>:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{dL}{d \theta} \right) = \frac{d}{d\theta} \left( a(t) \cdot f(x(t), t, \theta) \right)
$$</div>
<p>Integrating both sides over time gives:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\int_{t_0}^{t_N} \frac{dL}{d \theta} = \int_{t_0}^{t_N} a(t) \cdot \frac{\partial f(x(t), t, \theta)}{\partial \theta} dt
$$</div>
<p>But remember, we’re doing <strong>backpropagation</strong>. That means we’re starting from the <strong>final instant</strong>. 
So, for the same reason as before, we must treat <strong>sensitivity</strong> as a negative quantity and <strong>invert</strong> the sign of the integral, 
applying its <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/calculus/properties-of-integrals/">properties</a>:</p>
<div class="math">$$
-\int_{t_N}^{t_0} \frac{dL}{d \theta} = \int_{t_N}^{t_0} a(t) \cdot \frac{\partial f(x(t), t, \theta)}{\partial \theta} dt
$$</div>
<p>And thus, solving:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{dL(t_N)}{d \theta} - \frac{dL(t_0)}{d \theta} = \int_{t_N}^{t_0} a(t) \cdot \frac{\partial f(x(t), t, \theta)}{\partial \theta} dt
$$</div>
<p>We know this gradient <strong>accumulates the contribution of the weights with respect to the loss</strong>. 
Initially, this <em>container of contributions</em> is empty, and as we move backward through time, we can quantify and <strong>add</strong> them. 
This means that:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{dL(t_N)}{d \theta} = 0 
$$</div>
<p>so rewriting the equation above, we have:</p>
<p><a id="loss-integrale"></a>
</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{dL(t_0)}{d \theta} = -\int_{t_N}^{t_0} a(t) \cdot \frac{\partial f(x(t), t, \theta)}{\partial \theta} dt
$$</div>
<p class="formula-caption">
Formula 9. Integral Formulation of the Gradient</p>
<p>We have thus reached a <strong>new formulation of the error gradient</strong> that enables backpropagation.<br/>
And do you know what’s special about this formulation?<br/>
That it <strong>does not depend on the internal states</strong>.<br/>
And if you remember, that was exactly our problem. Since the neural network is hidden within a solver, we don’t have access to its internal states.<br/>
Even if we could find a way to save them, it wouldn’t be memory-efficient, because remember, we have hundreds of forward passes, and therefore hundreds of internal states.<br/>
Same story: we have an integral. So, once again, we call upon the solvers and write:</p>
<p><a id="loss-numerica"></a>
</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{dL(t_0)}{d\theta} = ODESolve \left( -a(t) \cdot \frac{df(x(t), t, \theta)}{d\theta}, 0, t_N, t_0 \right)
$$</div>
<p class="formula-caption">
Formula 10. Numerical Formulation of the Gradient</p>
<p>Since we started from <span class="math">\(t_N\)</span>, the value in <span class="math">\(\frac{dL(t_0)}{d\theta}\)</span> is the <strong>cumulative</strong> result of all the contributions gathered across time. 
It is therefore the <strong>complete gradient</strong> of the loss with respect to the weights <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>. This is precisely the value used to <strong>update the parameters</strong> 
during the optimization process.</p>
<p>Thus, the <a href="#adjoint-numerico">ODESolver</a> on the sensitivity function allows us to compute the <strong>instantaneous sensitivity</strong>, 
which is then used by the <a href="#loss-numerica">ODESolver</a> to compute the <strong>gradient function</strong>. 
One final piece remains: what are the <strong>inputs</strong> of our <span class="math">\(f(x(t), t, \theta)\)</span>? 
We know they are the states <span class="math">\(x(t)\)</span>, but where do these states come from? 
We had them during the <strong>forward</strong> phase, because they’re exactly what we computed with <a href="#formulazione-numerica-node">this ODESolver</a>. 
But, as we’ve said over and over, there are thousands of them, and storing them all would take too much memory. 
So how do we proceed? Well, once again… we use another ODE that solves our problem backward. 
So if <a href="#formulazione-numerica-node">this ODESolver</a> performs the forward pass, then the following:</p>
<p><a id="stato-numerico"></a>
</p>
<div class="math">$$
x(t_0) = ODESolve \left( f(x(t), t, \theta), x(t_N), t_N, t_0 \right)
$$</div>
<p class="formula-caption">
Formula 11. Numerical Formulation of the State in Backward</p>
<p><em>retraces our states backward</em>.
So we use the neural network again to predict the state, but instead of proceeding as</p>
<div class="math">$$
x_0 \longmapsto x_1 \longmapsto x_2 \cdots \longmapsto \longmapsto x_N
$$</div>
<p>we go in reverse:</p>
<div class="math">$$
x_N \longmapsto x_{N-1} \longmapsto x_{N-2} \longmapsto \cdots \longmapsto x_0
$$</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(x_N\)</span> is known, since it’s the output of the ODESolver from the forward phase.
So yes, computationally we must solve another ODE by performing <span class="math">\(n\)</span> forward passes of the neural network, but this way we <strong>instantaneously</strong> 
have the state <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span> needed to solve the ODE for <strong>sensitivity</strong>, and consequently, the one for the <strong>gradient</strong>.
And since this result is only needed for a <strong>single instant in time</strong>, once it’s used for one step we can discard it, keeping memory usage minimal. 
To conclude, it’s important to clarify one thing. We introduced this whole mechanism to <strong>avoid depending on the states</strong>, 
and now I’m telling you that we still need to <strong>compute them</strong>. Sounds like a contradiction, doesn’t it? Well, it isn't.<br/>
Before, we were dependent on the <strong>entire state</strong>, a <strong>matrix</strong> describing how every parameter influences every component of the system. 
Now, instead, we only depend on the <strong>value of the state over time</strong>, a <strong>vector</strong> that tells us where we are at that specific instant.
In other words, we no longer need to keep track of <em>all possible directions</em> of the evolution: it’s enough to know the <strong>current position</strong> 
to compute how the error propagates.</p>

I threw you into the Maenads and you came out as Orpheus. Not that that’s a good omen. Anyway, now that we have all the tools, let’s do a <strong>recap</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s start by looking at the following diagram that I so diligently sketched out for you:</p>
<p class="image-caption"><img alt="Insieme" class="image" src="https://www.lucadivita.it/en/images/teoria_matematica/neural_ode_4/all.svg"/>
Figure 8. Overview</p>
<p>Just like in traditional neural networks, training a NODE consists of two phases: <strong>forward</strong> and <strong>backward</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="forward">Forward<a class="headerlink" href="#forward" title="Permanent link"> </a></h4>
<p>We use an <strong>ODESolver</strong> (Euler, RK4, DOPRI5, etc.) from time <span class="math">\(t_0\)</span> to a chosen time <span class="math">\(t_N\)</span>, using a <strong>dynamics function</strong> defined by a neural network <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, with <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> as input:</p>
<div class="math">$$
x(t_N) = ODESolve(f(x(t), t, \theta), x_0, t_0, t_N)
$$</div>
<p>At time <span class="math">\(t_N\)</span>, we have our <strong>output</strong> (or prediction), given by the state <span class="math">\(x(t_N)\)</span>. We use the state <span class="math">\(x(t_N)\)</span> and the true output <span class="math">\(y\)</span> to calculate the Loss <span class="math">\(L\)</span> and its derivative
with respect to the state, which is the sensitivity at time <span class="math">\(t_N\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">$$
a(t_N) = \frac{dL}{dx(t_N)}
$$</div>
<p>Both <span class="math">\(x(t_N)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a(t_N)\)</span>, which have dimensions equal to the output of the neural network, are used in the backward steps.</p>
<h4 id="backward">Backward<a class="headerlink" href="#backward" title="Permanent link"> </a></h4>
<p>We use a system of <strong>three ODESolvers</strong>, of the same type used for the forward phase. All three solve the dynamics <strong>in reverse</strong>, starting
from <span class="math">\(t_N\)</span> and going back to <span class="math">\(t_0\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{cases}
x(t_0) = ODESolve \left( f(x(t), t, \theta), x(t_N), t_N, t_0 \right) \\
a(t_0) = ODESolve \left( -a(t) \cdot \frac{df(x(t), t, \theta)}{dx}, a(t_N), t_N, t_0 \right) \\
\frac{dL}{d\theta} = ODESolve \left( -a(t) \cdot \frac{df(x(t), t, \theta)}{d\theta}, 0, t_N, t_0 \right)
\end{cases}
$$</div>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first takes in the <strong>state</strong> <span class="math">\(x(t_N)\)</span> predicted in the forward phase and outputs the state at time <span class="math">\(x(t_{N-1})\)</span>.</li>
<li>The second takes in the <strong>sensitivity</strong> <span class="math">\(a(t_N)\)</span> calculated during the forward phase, and the <strong>current state</strong> <span class="math">\(x(t_{N-1})\)</span> calculated by the first ODESolver, and outputs the
sensitivity <span class="math">\(a(t_{N-1})\)</span> at time <span class="math">\(t_{N-1}\)</span>.</li>
<li>The third takes in the <strong>current sensitivity</strong> <span class="math">\(a(t_{N-1})\)</span> produced by the second ODESolver, and the <strong>current state</strong> <span class="math">\(x(t_{N-1})\)</span> from the first ODESolver. The output
of this ODESolver is a <strong>gradient matrix</strong> with the same dimensions as the neural network (or rather its parameters).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we reach time <span class="math">\(t_0\)</span>, we can use the gradient matrix produced by the third ODESolver, which contains the partial derivatives of the Loss with respect to the weights, to
update the weights of the network.</p>
<p>One final note before we move on to conclusions: If you have any <strong>doubts</strong> about how to calculate the derivatives</p>
<div class="math">$$
\frac{df}{dx}, \, \frac{df}{d\theta}, \, \frac{dL}{dx}
$$</div>
<p>It’s nothing more or less than what I’ve already shown you in the series of articles on neurons. 
Yet another reason to go check it out.</p>
<h3 id="to-wrap-up">To Wrap Up<a class="headerlink" href="#to-wrap-up" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>We've reached the end of this (final, for now) theoretical chapter on NODEs. It's been a long journey, starting from derivatives and integrals, that led us to formulate a <strong>continuous dynamic model</strong> capable of learning complex transformations over time.</p>
<p>As we've seen, NODEs are <strong>computationally more expensive</strong> than classic networks, but they offer <strong>unique advantages</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>They don’t need to store all intermediate activations, thus <strong>saving memory</strong>.</li>
<li>They can operate with <strong>smaller networks</strong>. Thanks to the continuous nature of integration, they are able to generalize better with less complex architectures.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, <strong>when does it make sense to use a NODE?</strong><br/>
As often happens in machine learning, the answer is: <strong>it depends</strong>.<br/>
If your problem involves <strong>continuous temporal dynamics</strong>, <strong>irregular data</strong>, or <strong>physical systems</strong> modelable through ODEs, then NODEs can truly make a difference.<br/>
In all other cases, they might just make your life more complicated.</p>
<p>In the next (and final) article of the series, we’ll finally get practical: we’ll look at a <strong>concrete</strong> application of NODEs and discuss some real-world use cases.</p>
<p>Until next time.</p>
