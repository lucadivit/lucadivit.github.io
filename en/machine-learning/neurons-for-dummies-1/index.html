<p>If you have ever heard about neural networks and thought: <em>"how the heck do they learn?"</em> you have landed in the right place.<br/>
Let's start immediately with a fresh spoiler of the day: there is no <strong>magic</strong>, just tons of <strong>multiplications</strong>, <strong>sums</strong>, and <strong>derivatives</strong>.<br/>
In this article, I want to tell you with calm and without panic, what happens inside an <strong>artificial neuron</strong> and how it <strong>learns from its mistakes</strong>, 
and we will do it step by step, with a practical example.</p>
<h3 id="anatomy-of-a-neural-network">Anatomy of a Neural Network<a class="headerlink" href="#anatomy-of-a-neural-network" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>Before understanding <em>how</em> a neural network works, we first need to clarify <em>what</em> a neural network actually is.
Let's start by saying that there are different types of neural networks: <strong>convolutional</strong>, <strong>recurrent</strong>, and many others.
One or the other is chosen depending on the problem to be solved.
In this article, we will focus on <strong>Multi Layer Perceptron</strong> networks (or <strong>MLP</strong>), which are usually represented like this:</p>
<p class="image-caption"><img alt="MLP" class="image" src="https://www.lucadivita.it/en/images/machine_learning/neurons_for_dummies/mlp.png"/>
Figure 1. Multi Layer Perceptron</p>
<p>The image may look simple, but behind that simplicity hides a number of concepts enough to make you want to commit harakiri.<br/>
And from this plethora of concepts... we will only scratch the surface.
Let's start by talking about what we have in front of our eyes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writings</li>
<li>Arrows</li>
<li>Dots</li>
</ul>
<p>Each little ball is called a <strong>neuron</strong> (or <strong>perceptron</strong>), and as you can see, they are arranged into <strong>layers</strong> (or, if you prefer, <strong>strata</strong>). Each
layer is <strong>fully connected</strong> to the next — meaning: all the neurons in one layer are linked to all the neurons in the next layer.
This already explains why these architectures are called <strong>MLP</strong>, or <strong>Multi Layer Perceptron</strong>. There are three types of layers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input Layer</strong>: Takes the data we provide as input. In the image, it is the yellow layer.</li>
<li><strong>Hidden Layer(s)</strong>: They are called this because we don't interact with them directly. Their job is to forward propagate the processed data. In the image, they are the green ones.</li>
<li><strong>Output Layer</strong>: Contains the result. In the image, it is the red layer.</li>
</ul>
<p>To give a practical example, let's suppose <strong>we can't recognize</strong> whether a picture shows a dog or a cat (and I sincerely hope this is just a supposition),
we feed our picture into the input layer, which receives the data.
This data is then processed by the hidden layers, and finally we get the result — <strong>dog or cat</strong> — in the output layer.<br/>
But before the network can say "dog" or "cat," it needs <strong>to be trained</strong>.
Training a neural network simply means giving it lots of pictures of dogs and cats, and <em>correcting</em> it every time it makes a mistake, in order to adjust the aim for future predictions.
If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering:
<em>"Ok, but how...?"</em>
Hold your horses, cowboy — we’ll get there.</p>
<h3 id="from-the-network-to-the-neuron">From the Network to the Neuron<a class="headerlink" href="#from-the-network-to-the-neuron" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>We have talked about networks, layers, arrows, and dots.<br/>
But to truly understand how a neural network makes decisions (and how it learns from its mistakes), we need to go down a level. Down to the level of the dot.<br/>
Let's start by looking at the stylization of a biological neuron.</p>
<p class="image-caption"><img alt="Biological Neuron" class="image" src="https://www.lucadivita.it/en/images/machine_learning/neurons_for_dummies/natural_neuron.png"/>
Figura 2. Biological Neuron</p>
<p>In life, I have few certainties, but one of them is that I am not a neurologist, so I hope the experts will forgive the simplification that follows.
The dendrites are <strong>stimulated</strong> by incoming electrical signals. The nucleus, together with the soma, <strong>processes</strong> the information, and the axon <strong>propagates</strong> it
toward the synaptic connections, linking to the next neurons.</p>
<p><strong>Does it ring a bell?</strong></p>
<p>Now that we know how a biological neuron "works" (yes, the quotation marks are intentional), let's take a big leap of imagination and see how an <strong>artificial neuron</strong> is represented, 
the now famous little dot:</p>
<p class="image-caption"><img alt="Artificial Neuron" class="image" src="https://www.lucadivita.it/en/images/machine_learning/neurons_for_dummies/artificial_neuron.png"/>
Figura 3. Artificial Neuron</p>
<p>From this image, we can introduce many of the concepts necessary for our purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input</strong>: these are the neuron's inputs, meaning what stimulates the dendrites.</li>
<li><strong>Weights</strong>: they are numerical values that indicate how important a particular input is. The higher the weight, the greater the influence of the input.
<em>Spoiler: the weights are the heart of everything, as we will soon see.</em></li>
<li><strong>Transfer Function</strong>: it serves to combine all the separate inputs into a single value. It is the equivalent of what the nucleus and soma do.</li>
<li><strong>Activation Function</strong>: it transforms the result of the transfer function. The output is connected to the neurons of the next layer, somewhat like the axon in biological neurons.</li>
<li><strong>Bias</strong>: it is a pure number whose role we will soon explain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Putting all the individual pieces together, we have that: the inputs <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span> and the weights <span class="math">\(w_i\)</span> pass through the transfer function <strong><span class="math">\(H\)</span></strong>, defined as:
</p>
<div class="math">$$
net = H(w_i, x_i) = \sum{x_i \cdot w_i} + b = x_1 \cdot w_1 + x_2 \cdot w_2 + \dots + x_n \cdot w_n + b
$$</div>
<p>performing what is called a <strong>weighted sum</strong>: each input is multiplied by its weight, everything is summed up, and the bias is added.<br/>
The result of the weighted sum is then passed through the activation function <span class="math">\(\sigma(H)\)</span>.<br/>
The <strong>output</strong> of the single neuron is therefore:</p>
<div class="math">$$
p = \sigma(H) = \sigma(x_1 \cdot w_1 + x_2 \cdot w_2 + \dots + x_n \cdot w_n + b) 
$$</div>
<p>There are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function" target="_blank">activation functions</a>, and their selection depends on various technical factors.<br/>
While it would be worth dedicating a full article to them, for now it’s enough to know that they are fundamental for introducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system" target="_blank">non-linearity</a>.<br/>
Which, for friends, simply means: without them, the network wouldn't even be able to correctly predict a dog from a cat.</p>
<p>Confused?</p>
<p>I would be surprised if you weren't. But don't worry, because now we have all the ingredients to see how a neuron works mathematically, and everything will become much clearer with a numerical example.</p>
<h3 id="a-numerical-example-the-and-problem">A Numerical Example. The AND Problem.<a class="headerlink" href="#a-numerical-example-the-and-problem" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>Let's start this new paragraph by introducing the problem to solve, the <strong>AND problem</strong>. The AND between two binary variables is a simple logical operation: 
the result is <span class="math">\(1\)</span> only if both variables are <span class="math">\(1\)</span> in all other cases, it is <span class="math">\(0\)</span>.
To be more formal, let's consider two variables <span class="math">\(A \in \{0, 1\}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B \in \{0, 1\}\)</span> the result of <span class="math">\(AND(x_1, x_2)\)</span> is summarized in the following table, called <strong>the truth table</strong>:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{array} 
{|r|r|}
\hline 
A &amp; B &amp; AND(A, B) \\ 
\hline 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 
\hline 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 
\hline 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 
\hline 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 
\hline  
\end{array}
$$</div>
<p>Here we presented the simplest case of the AND problem, but there’s no restriction on the number of variables.<br/>
For example, with three variables, we would get the following truth table:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{array} 
{|r|r|}
\hline 
A &amp; B &amp; C &amp; AND(A, B, C) \\ 
\hline 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 
\hline 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\ 
\hline 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 
\hline 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\ 
\hline 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 
\hline 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 
\hline 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 
\hline 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 
\hline  
\end{array}
$$</div>
<p>Let's now consider a neural network, the <strong>simplest possible</strong>: composed of a single perceptron. The goal is to solve the two-variable AND problem, that is: given the inputs
<span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_2\)</span>, predict what the output of <span class="math">\(AND(x_1, x_2)\)</span> which can be <span class="math">\(0\)</span> or <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. Since the output can take only two distinct values, <strong>either salt or pepper</strong>,
the problem we are dealing with is a typical <strong>classification problem</strong>.</p>
<p>Good: we have defined the problem and the architecture of the neural network.<br/>
Now, three things remain to be established:</p>
<ol>
<li>How many inputs do we have?</li>
<li>What are the values of the weights and the bias?</li>
<li>What is the activation function?</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's answer right away:</p>
<ol>
<li>The number of inputs depends on the variables of the problem. Since the AND problem is <strong>two-variable</strong>, also called <strong>features</strong> in the context of Machine Learning, 
the neuron will have two inputs <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> e <span class="math">\(x_2\)</span>, whose values can be <span class="math">\(0\)</span> o <span class="math">\(1\)</span>.</li>
<li>At this stage, we will assign the <strong>weights and bias</strong> ourselves. Let's suppose that:<ul>
<li>the weight related to the input <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> is <span class="math">\(w_1 = 0.5\)</span>,</li>
<li>the weight related to the input <span class="math">\(x_2\)</span> is <span class="math">\(w_2 = 0.5\)</span>,</li>
<li>the bias is <span class="math">\(b=1\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We choose the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function" target="_blank">Heaviside step function</a> as the activation function</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>Heaviside step</strong> is a simple function whose graph is as follows:</p>
<p class="image-caption"><img alt="Step Function" class="image" src="https://www.lucadivita.it/en/images/machine_learning/neurons_for_dummies/step.png"/>
Figura 4. Heaviside Step</p>
<p>In short, given any value <span class="math">\(x\)</span> as input, the Heaviside step function returns:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(0\)</span> if <span class="math">\(x &lt; 0\)</span>, </li>
<li><span class="math">\(1\)</span> otherwise. </li>
</ul>
<p>Mathematically:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\sigma(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
0 &amp; \text{if } x &lt; 0 \\
1 &amp; \text{if } x \geq 0
\end{cases}
$$</div>
<p>Why the Heaviside step function, you might be wondering?<br/>
Well, as mentioned earlier, there are many technical factors to consider, but suffice it to say that it’s the one that best fits our purpose:<br/>
the problem requires a solution that is either <span class="math">\(0\)</span> o <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, and the Heaviside step function returns exactly an output of <span class="math">\(0\)</span> o <span class="math">\(1\)</span>.
I'd say it's a perfect match, wouldn't you agree!?
<strong>But nope</strong>. For now for the sake of <strong>simplicity</strong>, we’ll settle for this, and the reason why... we’ll discover it later.</p>
<p>At this point, all that's left is to see how a neural network makes its predictions. And how do we see it? With a simple substitution of variables.<br/>
There are four possible cases. Remember that</p>
<div class="math">$$
H = x_1 \cdot w_1 + x_2 \cdot w_2 + \dots + x_n \cdot w_n + b
$$</div>
<p>that <span class="math">\(w_1 = 0.5, w_2 = 0.5, b = 1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\sigma(H) = 1\)</span> only if <span class="math">\(H \geq 0\)</span></p>
<p>We have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Case 1</strong>: <span class="math">\(x_1 = 0, x_2 = 0\)</span>
<span class="math center-math">\(H= 0 \cdot 0.5 + 0 \cdot 0.5 + 1 = 1 \Rightarrow p = \sigma(H) = \sigma(1) = 1\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Case 2</strong>: <span class="math">\(x_1 = 1, x_2 = 0\)</span>
<span class="math center-math">\(H= 1 \cdot 0.5 + 0 \cdot 0.5 + 1 = 1.5 \Rightarrow p = \sigma(H) = \sigma(1.5) = 1\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Case 3</strong>: <span class="math">\(x_1 = 0, x_2 = 1\)</span>
<span class="math center-math">\(H= 0 \cdot 0.5 + 1 \cdot 0.5 + 1 = 1.5 \Rightarrow p = \sigma(H) = \sigma(1.5) = 1\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Case 4</strong>: <span class="math">\(x_1 = 1, x_2 = 1\)</span>
<span class="math center-math">\(H= 1 \cdot 0.5 + 1 \cdot 0.5 + 1 = 2 \Rightarrow p = \sigma(H) = \sigma(2) = 1\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Let's now repeat the truth table, also showing the predictions made by the created perceptron, 
with incorrect ones highlighted in red and correct ones in green:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{array} 
{|r|r|r|}
\hline 
x_1 &amp; x_2 &amp; AND(x_1, x_2) &amp; p \\ 
\hline 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \color{red}{\mathbf{1}} \\ 
\hline 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \color{red}{\mathbf{1}}\\ 
\hline 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \color{red}{\mathbf{1}}\\ 
\hline 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; \color{green}{\mathbf{1}}\\ 
\hline  
\end{array}
$$</div>
<p>As we can see, our perceptron made <strong>only one correct prediction out of four</strong>. We can say it without mincing words: <strong>it sucks quite a bit</strong>, right?! 
So why all this fuss to reach such a poor result? Simple: because this is just the foundation.<br/>
Now, we still need to understand <strong>how to improve</strong> the results — that is, how to train the neural network so that it stops sucking and starts making sensible predictions...<br/>
But in the meantime, you've already achieved an important milestone:<br/>
Now you know that the "magic" behind predictions, or at least a good chunk of it, <strong>isn't that magical after all</strong>.</p>

<p>And to wrap it up... you thought I had forgotten, didn't you?! That I had sold you some nonsense. But no, my friends, I invite you to read the <strong>second part</strong>.
Surely you don't want to stop at just <em>how</em> the network predicts, right?!
You can't live without knowing <em>how it learns</em>.
Yes, I know, <em>I'm worse than the De Agostini magazine series... but that's how it is</em>.
While waiting for the second part, I bid you farewell.</p>
<p>Until next time.</p>
